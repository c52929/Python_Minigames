# Python_Minigames
This is my first python project. As practice of coding with python, I try making simple minigames. In my games, you will be asked about your actions. When you are asked about something, you can quit the game with answering "end", "exit", or "quit" any time.

Shinri Run: 
	4 players, which means you and 3 coms, run toward a goal placed 20 steps ahead from starting point.
	Each player chooses one from [1, 3, 5] as number of steps run (incidentally, coms choose numbers in a random manner), but if there are some players who choose the same number, they cannot run on that turn. 
	After repeating choosing number and running, player who reach 20 steps first will be winner.

Janken: 
	You and com fight with showing each hand as a rock, as a piece of paper or as scissors. Rock is stronger than scissors, scissors are stronger than paper, and paper is stronger than rock. If you and com show the same, you will have one more chance to fight.
