Shinri Run
	4 players, which means you and 3 coms, run toward a goal placed 20 steps ahead from starting point.
	Each player choose one from [1, 3, 5] as number of steps run (incidentally, coms choose numbers in a random manner), but if there are some players who choose the same number, they cannot run on that turn. 
	After repeating choosing number and running, player who reach 20 steps first will be winner.
